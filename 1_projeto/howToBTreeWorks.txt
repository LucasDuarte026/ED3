Criei só para eu ter um resumo de como analiso uma B-Tree(Ficar mais facil de encontrar):


Certainly! A B-tree is a self-balancing tree data structure that maintains sorted data in a way that allows for efficient insertion, deletion, and lookup operations. It's particularly well-suited for systems that read and write large blocks of data, like databases and file systems. Here's a detailed explanation of how B-trees work:
Basic Properties

    Balanced Tree: A B-tree is a balanced tree, not in the sense that the left and right subtrees of every node have the same height, but in that every path from the root to a leaf has the same length. This ensures that all leaf nodes are at the same level.

    Nodes: Each node in a B-tree can have a variable number of keys and children. The keys within a node are always sorted.

    Order of the Tree: The 'order' of a B-tree is a fundamental property that dictates the capacity of each node. For a B-tree of order m:
        Each internal node (except the root) can contain a minimum of ⌈m/2⌉ - 1 and a maximum of m - 1 keys.
        The root node can have a minimum of 1 key (unless the tree is empty) and a maximum of m - 1 keys.
        Each internal node (except the root) can have a minimum of ⌈m/2⌉ and a maximum of m children.

Operations

    Search: To find a key in a B-tree, start at the root and traverse the tree. Compare the key with the keys in the current node and go to the appropriate child based on the comparison.

    Insertion: To insert a key:
        Find the correct leaf node where the key should be inserted.
        Insert the key into this leaf node in the correct position to maintain the sorted order.
        If the leaf node overflows (i.e., has more than m - 1 keys), split it into two nodes and move the median key up to the parent. This process may cascade up to the root, possibly causing the tree to grow in height.

    Deletion: To delete a key:
        Find the key in the tree and remove it.
        If the key is in an internal node, replace it with its in-order predecessor (the largest key in its left subtree) or successor (the smallest key in its right subtree) and then delete that key.
        If removing the key causes a node to have fewer than the minimum number of keys, rebalance the tree. This might involve merging nodes or redistributing keys from adjacent siblings.

Balancing

    Splitting Nodes: When a node exceeds the maximum number of keys, it is split into two nodes, and the median key is moved up to the parent. This keeps the tree balanced.
    Merging Nodes: If a node falls below the minimum number of keys, it can merge with a sibling. If the sibling has extra keys, a redistribution can occur instead of a merge.

Advantages

    Efficiency: B-trees are efficient for large datasets because they reduce the number of disk reads. This is because they store multiple keys in each node and have a high branching factor, leading to a shallow tree.
    Balanced Nature: The tree remains balanced at all times, ensuring that all basic operations (insertion, deletion, search) can be performed in O(log n) time.

Use Cases

    Databases and File Systems: B-trees are widely used in databases and file systems where large blocks of data are stored and retrieved from disk. They are optimized for systems where reading or writing to disk is a primary operation.

In summary, B-trees are designed to work efficiently on disks or other direct-access secondary storage devices. They are a key component in many database systems due to their ability to handle a large amount of data while maintaining a balanced structure for quick access.
